    <p>
        I was born and raised in Texas with all the love and support I could ask for. I was rather quiet as a child, but very active, preferring to put my energy into physical accomplishments that to apply my brain. 
        A lot of things came pretty easily to me, so I never had to try all that hard at anything to get by.  
        From an early age, I had an aptitude for gymnastics, and found myself on a competitive team in junior high, but this required more work to keep up on my studies than I was willing to put in, my grades fell, and my mom put an end to it. 
        I grew up in the age of Guitar Hero, and my love of that game turned into a bonafide ability to play the guitar. When I was 22, I had a son. He's my everything and my reason for attending this class.  
        I want to give him the life he deserves, and that means growing up and applying my brain and realizing my actual potential.
